Smackbook for OS X Yosemite
==================

This is an updated version of Erling Ellingsen's Smackbook script originally written in 2006.

I found this online after being virtually untouched for roughly eight years. (To put this in perspective, I was in the 7th grade when this script was initially released. As of this writing, I am a senior in college.) All it took was changing a few lines to update it to work for OS X Yosemite.
