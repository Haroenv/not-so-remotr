Smackbook for OS X Yosemite
==================

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iyeqh9zHf8

This is an updated version of Erling Ellingsen's Smackbook script originally written in 2006.

I found this online after being virtually untouched for roughly eight years. (To put this in perspective, I was in the 7th grade when this script was initially released. As of this writing, I am a senior in college.) All it took was changing a few lines to update it to work for OS X Yosemite.

USAGE
---------------

To use this script:

* Download AMSTracker from here: http://www.osxbook.com/software/sms/amstracker/
* Extract the AMSTracker program from the .dmg and place it in the same folder as the script
* Open up Terminal and run
    perl smackbookyosemite.pl
* ???
* Profit
